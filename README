# SoundCloud API presentation
A slide deck to present the SoundCloud API

## How to use

Clone the repository from Github:

    $ git clone git@github.com:soundcloud/soundcloud-api-presentation.git

And make sure you're in the project's folder. This presentation tool relies on a gem called Shining[1], install it here:

    $ gem install shining

The slides are all written in Markdown[2], but you can add HTML in there as well to show code examples. Slides are indexed in config.json, where you can manage the order and some settings.

To add a slide, do

    $ shine slide SLIDENAME markdown

This will add a new slide to the end of the list, you can correct the order in config.json later.


You can start a small server to run your presentation locally, do

    $ shine go

The server will start, you can view your brand new presentation at [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/).

## Some considerations

SyntaxHighlighter is included in the template, insert your code like this:

    $ <pre class="brush: html"> console.log('hello world'); </pre>

When demonstrating client side code (e.g. iframes), make sure the iframe is packed with the presentation. Browsers will complain if you execute scripts in iframes that are not on the same domain.
